# TaC-Test-addon
An experimental TaC addon.  
As of now, some features of TaC used in this project have not been merged into the official version of TaC.  
If you want to try it, please use our unoffical fork of TaC as dependency: 
[TaC-LesRaisins](https://github.com/LesRaisins-Studios/TimelessandClassics_Reforged)

Please note that, none of this addon or the “TaC-LesRaisins” have undergone comprehensive testing.  
The content related to survival mode has not been added yet, and overall it has not reached playable status.  
We strongly DO NOT recommend using it in a production environment, especially servers or the save you are playing with.  
Possible risks include save corruption or incompatibility, etc.

If you insist on doing so, it's ON YOUR OWN RISK.
